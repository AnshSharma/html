Learning to code, eh?

Oh okay you're lost.

"What's up with all this?", you'd ask. 

## About GitHub

To begin with, this is GitHub. It's just like Facebook. The slight difference is that I use Facebook to share images and status updates, while I use GitHub to share pieces of code. Specifically, when I write a program, I'll upload its code on GitHub so that you can learn from the code or you can modify and use that piece of code to create your own program. (Woohoo!)

## Setting things up

**A curious learner:** Hey Ansh, I know a bit of basic HTML, can you help me learn more?

Hey curious learner, why not! Everyone wants to have a cool website (along with a fidget spinner) these days. (And no, Amazon isn't giving them together) First we're going to download some cool softwares, which would help you to code faster.

You can try either [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) or [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/). I prefer to use Sublime Text for coding in HTML.
